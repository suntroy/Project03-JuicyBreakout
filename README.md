# Project03 -- JuicyBreakout

# "break out"
Created 10-4-2025, as an exercise on executing "juiciness" within simple video game constraints

For this project, I was given the basic breakout game template, and expected to add visual and auditory details to 
enhance the aesthetic and 'feel' of the game. I utilized an oceanic, laid back atmosphere, through main menu music, color palette,
custom sprites, game music, game sounds, and physics. 

## Implementation
Built using Unity 2022.3.45f

Shaders via main menu background
Customized buttons and text
Music both in-game and for main menu
Sound effects for paddle collision, block collision, and ball death
Custom sprites for paddle and ball
Imported text for UI
Imported background for in-game
Ball and paddle glow
Ball "bounciness" and trail
Particle effects for when paddle is hit, and when a block is broken
Animation for blocks entering scene and being destroyed
